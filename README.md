# catppuccin-overrides

Catppuccin themes are among the most accessible and easiest to customize themes available. So here are some overrides for my own styles.

# Usage

Execute `src/index.ts` and supply a theme name as an argument.\
The output can be found in the `out` folder.

`--firefoxTheme`\
If this flag is provided it will generate a firefox manifest for a theme under `out/firefox/manifest.json`

Current available themes are:

- pink
- yellow

# Helpers

The `link.bash` script links some files to the relevant places just give the name of the theme as the argument

## Future notes

- kvantum theme
- transparent firefox
